# Landing-Page
This landing page project has been developed with the aim of honing and improving my HTML and CSS skills. It is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. The landing page incorporates a responsive design, ensuring its adaptability across various screen dimensions. 

# Credits
For this project, I chose to use Electro-themed elements inspired by the game Genshin Impact as placeholders. All the images and quotes used are from the game itself. Abilities description from <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Electro>here</a>. The color scheme used in this project was generated using coolors.co.
